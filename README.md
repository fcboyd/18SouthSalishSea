18 South Salish Sea is designed as an 18xx Magazine game based on 18India (similar to 18Boswash or King of Trains and Train of Kings). 
A copy of 18India is required to play and all rules apply except where called out in the rulebook for South Salish Sea. 

High-Level Rules Summary for 18India, which are applicable:

SR:
Sell Round:
- There is a single sell round before each SR. This is the only opportunity for players to sell any shares that they would like. Selling shares does not impact the ability to buy shares in the company during the SR.
  * There is no market limit on shares, and a managed company can be sold down to 0% owned shares. If no one owns shares in a company, the company is run by the previous manager.
  * The Directors' share may not be sold to the bank once it has been purchased.
  * Selling shares does not impact market value.
    
Stock Round:
- Companies float when 30% is in players' hands + the bank
  * The company is managed if it floats with 3 10% shares
  * The company is directed if it floats with the directors' 20% certificate and a 10% certificate.
- Can perform one of the following as an action:
  1) Purchase 1 or 2 shares from a single IPO row paying the printed cost to the company treasury
  2) Purchase any number of shares from a single company from your hand paying the printed cost to the company treasury.
  3) Purchase a single share from the bank at market value
  4) Pass
- Turn order is based on order of passing. I.e. first to pass goes first, next to pass goes 2nd.

Operating Round:
- Lay Track: **There is no phase restriction for tile upgrades. Must upgrade in order, but do not have to wait for a certain train purchase to trigger a phase**
  1) Lay up to 4 yellow track in a single path (cannot branch off in two different directions)
  2) Upgrade a single tile
- Place a station token: Cannot place two tokens in 00 tiles, or any individual offboard.
- Run Trains:
  * The value of the ? + [X] cities is equal to the highest value standard city (i.e. not an offboard) included in the route of that train + the modified value [X]. If no standard cities are hit by that train, the base value is $20 + [X]. For E trains, the standard city does not have to be one of the 4 counted cities, the train just must pass through that city on its route.
  * Dits are free for standard trains
  * E trains do not count dits, and can run a train of infinite length (assuming they are not blocked by a token in a city), counting the 4 highest revenue centers on the router
  * x2 / x3 trains double/triple the route revenue. This multiplication is performed prior to adding any route bonuses.
- Pay Dividends: Can pay out or withhold. If payout can jump 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x. If withheld, drop once on the market. Any shares in the IPO or players' hands are paid to the bank.
- Purchase / Sell Trains:
  * Once the last 4/4E is purchased, all phase IV trains become available (i.e. 4x2, 3x2, 3x3, 4x3).
  * Train limit is always 2 for all companies
  * Some trains can be purchased as either a standard train or an E train. Must be decided at the time of purchase and cannot be flipped during a cross-train purchase.
  * Trains can be sold for the sale price. Cannot sell trains that were purchased from the train market that round.
- Sell Certificates:
  * Companies can sell owned certificates to the bank.
- Purchase a Certificate:
  * Companies may purchase a single certificate from the bank or IPO. The certificate limit for companies is 3.
**If a company does not own a train at the end of its OR, it falls back an additional spot on the market**

Game End:
- See game-specific end-game conditions
- Share value is based on the **book value**
  * Book value is market price + assets. Calculate [total value of owned trains (using purchase price)] + [company treasury] + [value of owned shares] divided by 10.
  * Share value = [book value from above calculation] + [market value]
- The winner is the player with the highest value from personal cash + total share value of owned shares.
